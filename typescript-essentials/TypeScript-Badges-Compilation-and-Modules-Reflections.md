## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**:
   Learned about TS main features (e.g static type checking), compilation process, how to install TS.
   It seems that TS features are extremely useful in building sophisticated applications. I do appreciate an opportunity to validate that code is working correctly before running it.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**:
   Learned about enum, void and any types wich are not exising in JS, explicit type annotations and implicit type inference, how to declare variables using primitive types, object types, intersection types.
   The enumeration type as well as tuples in my opinion are a great extensions of standart types.
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**:
   Learned about interfaces, the reasons for using them, ways to work with them and also about type alias. interfaces are a powerful way to define the shape or structure of objects and classes. Using interfaces apparently is very helpful with following DRY and KISS principles, maintainable and scalable code.
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**:
   Learned about implementing functions in TS, sintaxis of function declaration, function expression and arrow functions in TS, required, optional and default parameters and necessity of typing return values.
   Specifying the types of parameters and return values for functions helps catch errors during development and provides better tooling support.
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**:
   Learned about type annotations for class members, public, private and protected access modifiers, static properties and methods in TS. Class sintaxis in TS is very simular with JS, and as well as in JS using classes in TS helps to model and structure your code in a more organized manner, providing OOP concepts.
6. **Generics in TypeScript**:
   Learned about generics - a way to create a reusable code templates, its sintaxis, using extends and keyof operators and typeof type guard.
   Generics seems to be useful way to improve reusable code. It wasn't clear how one can create all-propose functions and classes wich can work with lots of types to improve readability and reusability without using type any, and now it became plain and simple.
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**:
   Learned how modules work in TS and how to use libraries.
   The sintacses of using modules in TS for me looks the same as in JS, which is good. It was interesting to know about existing analog of modules - namespaces.
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**:
   Learned more about namespaces. Thought TS documentation recommends not to use namespaces as an option of organasing the code, this module definitely useful because it will help to understand the legacy.
