## Reflections

6. **Generics in TypeScript**:
   Generics seems to be useful way to improve reusable code. It wasn't clear how one can create all-propose functions and classes wich can work with lots of types to improve readability and reusability without using type any, and now it became plain and simple.
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**:
   The sintacses of using modules in TS for me looks the same as in JS, which is good. It was interesting to know about existing analog of modules - namespaces.
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**:
   Thought TS documentation recommends not to use namespaces as an option of organasing the code, this module definitely useful because it will help to understand the legacy.
